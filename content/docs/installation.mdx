<Steps>

### React + Typescript

Edil ozi currently supports only **React** framework. All components are written in **TypeScript**.

### Prerequisites

These are the main dependencies you will need to get started.

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss@latest clsx tailwind-merge framer-motion
```

Note: _Some components may require **additional dependencies** (ex: [gsap](https://gsap.com/)). Each component that requires an additional dependency will display a badge indicating that dependency._

### Utilities

Copy and paste the following code into your project.

```typescript
// lib/utils.ts
import clsx, { ClassValue } from "clsx";
import { twMerge } from "tailwind-merge";

export function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) {
  return twMerge(clsx(inputs));
}
```

### Install components

That's it! Now you can go to any [component](/components) page and follow the instructions there

All components are presented in **dark** and **light** mode.
