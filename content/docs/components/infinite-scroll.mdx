<ComponentPreview name="infinite-scroll-demo" />

<Steps>

### Installation

Copy and paste the following code into your project.

```text
components/edil-ozi/infinite-scroll.tsx
```

<ComponentSource name="infinite-scroll" />

</Steps>

### Note

Adjust `gap` and `height` using `vh` unit for your case.

For fullscreen sections, consider using the following formula to get the values you need

```js
 gap = 4vh
 height = (100 / 2) - (gap / 2) //= 48vh
 So the result will be `gap = 4vh` and `height = 48vh`
```
